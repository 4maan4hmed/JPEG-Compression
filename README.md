# JPEG-Compression
This MATLAB project demonstrates JPEG compression by converting an image to YCbCr, downsampling chrominance components, applying DCT to 8x8 blocks, quantizing DCT coefficients, and using Huffman coding. It displays the original and compressed images and calculates the compression ratio.
